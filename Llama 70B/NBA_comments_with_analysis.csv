Wemby is not having that same halo effect, which tells me he's playing elite individual defense moreso than elite team defense.  Which isn't surprising at all - he's a 19 year old rookie.

NBA,True,"Kerr makes good short-term adjustments (see: Warriors' reputation for dominating the third quarter of games). But he tends to quickly revert back to less-successful tactics.
