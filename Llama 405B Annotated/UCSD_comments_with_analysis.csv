May I ask why? 

As an in-state student, I will admit I would much rather have in-person lectures.

However, I am willing to take another year, if necessary, of online classes.

However, if it's unfair because of economic value, I think it's somewhat on par with what out-of-state/international students have to pay. Even if they are receiving in-person classes, the amount out-of-state students pay, I believe, offset that.
